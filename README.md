This project implements a multi-threaded binary search tree (BST) management system in C, designed for efficient and thread-safe operations such as adding, removing, balancing, and querying nodes. It uses pthread read-write locks to synchronize access, allowing concurrent reads while ensuring exclusive writes for updates and tree balancing. The program simulates client-server interactions by processing client commands from input files and includes a background thread for periodic tree maintenance. With dynamic memory management and a focus on performance, this implementation demonstrates core concepts of multi-threaded programming, synchronization, and efficient data structure handling.
